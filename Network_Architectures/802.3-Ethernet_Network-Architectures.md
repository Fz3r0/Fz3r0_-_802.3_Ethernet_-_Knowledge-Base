# Network Architecture


| **Network Architecture**           | **Status**    | **Primary Purpose**                 | **Short Description**                                                                                 | **Common Devices**                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hierarchical (3-Tier)**          | Current       | Enterprise, high-density networks   | Uses **core**, **distribution**, and **access** layers for structured, scalable networks.             | Core switches, distribution switches, access switches, routers, firewalls.                          |
| **Spine-Leaf**                     | Current       | Data centers                        | Features a flat architecture with **spine** and **leaf** layers; ideal for virtualized environments.  | Spine switches, leaf switches, SDN controllers, servers.                                            |
| **Tree Topology**                  | Current       | Campus networks, medium/large       | Expands hierarchical networks with additional layers for redundancy and load balancing.               | Core switches, access switches, routers, wireless controllers, firewalls.                           |
| **Mesh Topology**                  | Current       | Critical networks, high availability| All nodes interconnect; ensures redundancy and fault tolerance.                                       | Routers, switches, firewalls, wireless access points (for wireless mesh).                           |
| **Collapsed Core**                 | Current       | Small/medium networks               | Combines **core** and **distribution** layers to reduce cost and simplify management.                 | Core/distribution switches, routers, firewalls, wireless access points.                             |
| **SDN (Software Defined Network)** | Current       | Data centers, advanced networks     | Centralized control plane; separates data and control for dynamic, programmable networks.             | SDN controllers, virtual switches, physical switches, servers, virtual routers (cloud-based).       |
| **Hybrid Network**                 | Current       | Corporate, multi-site               | Integrates multiple technologies; provides flexibility for diverse network needs.                     | Mix of switches, routers, firewalls (on-premises or cloud-based), load balancers.                   |
| **Dual-Ring Network**              | Current       | Industrial or telecom networks      | Redundant rings ensure high availability for time-sensitive operations.                               | Industrial switches, routers, Metro Ethernet devices.                                               |
| **Point-to-Multipoint**            | Current       | Wireless networks, ISPs             | Distributes connectivity from a single source to multiple endpoints efficiently.                      | Wireless access points, antennas, base stations, routers.                                           |
| **Zonal Network Architecture**     | Current       | Segmented networks, hospitals       | Divides networks into zones using **IDFs**, **MDFs**, or logical segments for better organization.    | MDF switches, IDF switches, routers, firewalls, access points.                                       |
| **Point-to-Point**                 | Legacy/Current| WAN links, dedicated connections    | Simple direct link between two devices; effective but lacks scalability.                              | Routers, Ethernet switches, modems (for legacy WAN links).                                           |
| **Star Topology**                  | Legacy        | Home networks, small offices        | Central device connects to all endpoints; easy to set up but lacks redundancy.                        | Home routers, small unmanaged switches, wireless access points.                                     |
| **Bus Topology**                   | Legacy        | Small local networks                | All devices connect to a single cable; simple but outdated for most modern networks.                  | Ethernet hubs, coaxial cables, older switches (legacy).                                             |
| **Ring Topology**                  | Legacy        | Transport networks, industrial      | Devices form a closed loop; provides redundancy but slower than modern solutions.                     | Metro Ethernet switches, SONET/SDH devices, industrial ring switches.                               |
